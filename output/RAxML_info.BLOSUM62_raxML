IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences F1|sp|P68871|HBB_HUMAN and F1|sp|P68873|HBB_PANTR are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 4 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file BLOSUM62.fasta.reduced
